User Story: E-Commerce Checkout Testing Requirements

=============================================================================
BACKGROUND & CONTEXT
=============================================================================

As a QA Engineer testing the ShopMaster Pro e-commerce platform, I need comprehensive test scenarios that cover all aspects of the checkout process to ensure a seamless customer experience and robust system functionality.

The checkout system handles multiple complex workflows including:
- Multi-step form validation
- Real-time price calculations
- Payment processing integration
- Discount code management
- Shipping cost calculation
- Inventory management
- User session handling

=============================================================================
CRITICAL TEST AREAS
=============================================================================

1. FORM VALIDATION TESTING
   - Email format validation with various invalid inputs
   - Phone number format checking (US and international)
   - Address validation including ZIP/postal codes
   - Credit card number validation using Luhn algorithm
   - Required field enforcement and error messaging
   - Special character handling and sanitization
   - Maximum length restrictions on all input fields

2. PAYMENT GATEWAY INTEGRATION
   - Credit card processing (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover)
   - Digital wallet integration (PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay)
   - Declined payment handling and retry mechanisms
   - Partial payment scenarios and refund processing
   - Currency conversion for international customers
   - PCI compliance verification and security testing

3. DISCOUNT CODE SYSTEM
   - Percentage-based discounts (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%)
   - Fixed amount discounts ($5, $10, $25 off)
   - Minimum order value requirements
   - Free shipping promotions
   - Expired code handling
   - Already used code detection
   - Invalid code format rejection
   - Case sensitivity testing (SAVE15 vs save15)

4. SHOPPING CART FUNCTIONALITY
   - Add/remove items with quantity validation
   - Quantity limits enforcement (1-99 per item)
   - Price calculations including tax and shipping
   - Cart persistence across browser sessions
   - Inventory availability checking
   - Out of stock item handling
   - Cart timeout and session management

5. SHIPPING CALCULATION
   - Domestic shipping rates by zone
   - International shipping options
   - Free shipping threshold testing ($75 minimum)
   - Express and overnight delivery options
   - Weight-based shipping calculations
   - Address validation for shipping availability
   - PO Box and APO/FPO address handling
